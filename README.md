# touch-scroll-physics

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Physics for a touch-based scroll panel. Assumes a single dimension but could easily be extended to two or more.

Works best with scroll panes that have a fixed bounding region and need to "bounce" on either end.
